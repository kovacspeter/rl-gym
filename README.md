Implementation of RL algos with openAI gym

In this repository I will try to implement recent papers on DEEP RL.

Papers: 
 * (DDPG) CONTINUOUS CONTROL WITH DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING [http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971v5.pdf] -> CODE[https://github.com/kovacspeter/rl-gym/tree/master/DDPG]
 * (NAF)  Continuous Deep Q-Learning with Model-based Acceleration[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.00748v1.pdf] -> CODE(in progress)
 * (A3C)  Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783v2.pdf] -> CODE(in progress)
 * (TRPO) Trust Region Policy Optimization[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.05477v4.pdf] -> CODE(in progress)
 
 Feel free to submit push requests and open issues.
